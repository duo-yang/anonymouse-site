				<div class="message-body">
					<p>The mission of the marketing team is to help the team understand and connect with our customers and supporters. Marketing is divided into two subteams â€“ research and outreach.  The research team gathers information through research, surveys, and in-person interviews and analyzes it rigorously to understand the customers. We also help the developers determine what values and features to focus on. The outreach team identifies and communicates with potential customers and supporters, including beta testers.</p>

					<p>Most of my research and teaching focuses on special-purpose computers called embedded systems. Prior research results from my team suggest that infrastructureless microblogging that is resistant to blocking and censorship can be practical within towns and cities. I am helping the Anonymouse team make such a system real.</p>
