				About Anonymouse
			</h1>
			<h2 class="slogan-subtitle light-gray">Anonymouse is an app dedicated to censorship-free communiation and anonymous engagement.</h2>
			<h2 class="slogan-subtitle light-gray">
				There was a time when most people learned about the world from a few professional communicators.  The Internet opened communication to the masses. In many cases they were more accurate and creative, and their interests and ideas more diverse.
			</h2>
			<h2 class="slogan-subtitle light-gray">           
				But, from the start, there was a thorn in this rose.  The Internet is hierarchical.  Control a few routers or nameservers at the top of the hieararchy, and you have a chokehold on it.  Its structure leaves its innocent users vulnerable to wiretapping, censorship, and disruption by those who see themselves as judges of mankind.
			 </h2>
			 <h2 class="slogan-subtitle light-gray">           
				We have been working to design a real alternative.  Our approach is to support direct and transitive wireless communication among smartphones without reliance on vulnerable infrastructure.
